I will be implementing these topics in the code: 

1. jwt auth middleware
2. public and priv routes
3. email verify , phone verify
4. express projects

Authentication methods:

1. Using JWT Authentication
2. Using session based storage

Always divide your API's into 2 types.

1. public
2. private

Public API's - they dont require authentication
ex: register, login, forgot password

Private APIs - Which require authentication
example: username, email and password should be authenticated
apis like get my profile, get all posts, update my profile, delete my profile, delete all posts(basically all crud operations of a role)
